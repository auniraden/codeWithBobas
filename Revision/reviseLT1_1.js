/**
 * JavaScript Array.prototype provides a number of iteration methods that can solve problems with JavaScript Array objects, and these functions are designed to be generally applicable to all objects that "look like" Arrays, without actually implementing the logic in a general cycle. Given the array of cars  objects as attached. write a functional Javascript code:

i)	To get multiple items from an array that match a condition -red color



ii)To transform objects of an array into an array of different objects, to classify our cars into three groups based on their size:

small car = 1-3 people
medium car = 4-5 people
large car = 6-9 people


iii) To sort the cars based on their capacity in descending order.


iv) Find the mean of the car sales(price) for each month.


v) Find the total sales(price) for each car type.



let cars = [
  {
    "color": "purple",
    "car_type": "minivan",
    "price": 170103,
    "capacity": 7,
    "date": "2023-01-01"
  },
  {
    "color": "red",
    "car_type": "station wagon",
    "price": 181323,
    "capacity": 5,
    "date": "2023-01-05"
  },
  {
  "color": "blue",
  "car_type": "minivan",
  "price": 123223,
  "capacity": 7,
  "date": "2023-02-01"
  },
  {
  "color": "red",
  "car_type": "cabrio",
  "price": 161522,
  "capacity": 2,
  "date": "2023-02-03"
  },
  {
 "color": "blue",
 "car_type": "cabrio",
 "price": 161522,
 "capacity": 2,
 "date": "2023-03-04"
  }
]
